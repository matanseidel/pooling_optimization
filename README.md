# pooling_optimization

A python (3.8) script doing the following in the context of group testing:
- calculation of binary entropy and entropy bound on efficiency.
- calculation of efficiency for the simple Dorfman algorithm.
- calculation of efficiency for a matrix pooling algorithm with/without retesting of deduceable positives.
- simulation of Dorfman and matrix pooling algorithm (with/without retesting of deduceable positives).
